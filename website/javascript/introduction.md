Last year, millions of learners from our community started with JavaScript. 

Why? JavaScript is primarily known as the language of most modern web browsers, and its early quirks gave it a bit of a bad reputation.

However, the language has continued to evolve and improve. 

JavaScript is a powerful, flexible, and fast programming language now being used for increasingly complex web development and beyond!
